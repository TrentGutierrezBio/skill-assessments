```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

To add a user: $ sudo adduser [name]
to delete a user: $ sudo userdel -r [name]
to add a password to a user: $ sudo passwd [name]
                               Make a password ^

to give our user Sudo access: $ sudo usermod -a -G wheel [name] 
                                (I think the wheel group should give 
                                 our user permission to use sudo)
