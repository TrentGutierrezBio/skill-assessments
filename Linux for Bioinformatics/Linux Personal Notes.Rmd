```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

To add a user: $ sudo adduser [name]
to delete a user: $ sudo userdel -r [name]
to add a password to a user: $ sudo passwd [name]
                               Make a password ^

to give our user Sudo access: $ sudo usermod -a -G wheel [name] 
                                (I think the wheel group should give 
                                 our user permission to use sudo)
                                 
add a home directory for our user: $sudo mkhomedir_helper [name]
                                   $pwd (to double check if it worked)
                                  
                                  
If you can't delete a user due to a process use: $sudo pkill -KILL -u [user]
                                                 $sudo deluser ubuntu
                                                
Key-less server set up: $sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
                        replace password authentication "no" with "yes"
                        $sudo systemctl restart ssh
