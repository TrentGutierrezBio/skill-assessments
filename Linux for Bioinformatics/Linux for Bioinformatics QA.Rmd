Q6. What is the error?
A6: Server refused our key 
    No Supported authentication methods available

Q7. What was the solution?
A7: The solution to this problem was to: 
    - Create a new key pair for a new pem file
    - Import the pem file to my local Ubuntu env, using MobaXterm's import feature
    - Right click the pem file and adjust the settings to be more secure (400, user read only)
    - Now on another tab, connect via ec2-user 
    - (Sudouser should be created and password protected) 
    - switch to the sudouser
    - create the .ssh directory 
    - adjust permissions of the folder to 700
    - create a file named "authorized_keys" 
    - adjust this file's permissions to 600
    - nano the key file 
    - back on Ubuntu: extract the public key from the private pem file
    - copy and paste this string into the key nano 
    - save key file 
    - Now sudouser should be allowed to connect using the new pem key and be password protected. 
    
Q8.1 what does the sudo docker run part of the command do? 
A8.1
1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.

    to your terminal.
